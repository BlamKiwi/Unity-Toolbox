Unity Toolbox is a collection of classes to supplement Unity's built in engine framework. Although Unity is a great little game engine it still lacks functionality common to many game engines, such as a non trivial Event Management or tools to help Localization. As I create these classes for my own games, I will refactor them for the general public and share them here.

Unless otherwise specified, code released in UnityToolbox will be licensed under the two clause BSD license. The license will be stated at the top of every code file, and a LICENSE file will summarize what licenses there are in each module.
